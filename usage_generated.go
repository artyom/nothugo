const usage = "Command nothugo is a basic static site generator, taking *.md files as its\ninput. Its main focus is simplicity and not getting in a way of existing file\nhierarchies.\n\nUsage: nothugo [flags] [mode]\n\nModes are:\n\nrender:\n\nIn this mode program recursively walks input directory (-src), renders *.md\nfiles to HTML, writin output to the output directory (-dst), keeping the same\nfile tree structure. Files with names that don't match *.md pattern are either\nhard-linked (if possible), or copied to the destination directory. Non-regular\nfiles, or files/directories with names starting with \".\" (unix hidden) are\nskipped.\n\nserve:\n\nIn this mode program starts basic HTTP server (-addr) serving static files from\nthe output directory (-dst). It is not the only way to serve generated content,\nthis can be done with any web server. Most useful for local previews.\n\nexample:\n\nIn this mode program generates example content in the input (-src) and templates\n(-templates) directories. It is best used to create scaffolding for a new\nproject or get a sense on how this tool works. As a precaution it refuses to\noverwrite existing files.\n"
